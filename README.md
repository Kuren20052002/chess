<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is part of my coursework on The Odin Project, a platform guiding my journey to becoming a full-stack developer. The goal is to create a fully playable chess game in Ruby, representing my most ambitious project to date. This endeavor aims to enhance my problem-solving skills, deepen my understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP), and refine my test-driven development (TDD) practices, while advancing my overall programming proficiency.

Chess is a complex game with unique movement patterns for each piece on an 8x8 board, all centered around the objective of capturing the opponentâ€™s king. I anticipate facing numerous challenges throughout this project but am eager to address them and learn from the experience.
